Another music player created with ~~[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)~~ [Crowsa](https://codeberg.org/pparaxan/Crowsa).

[~~This version of~~](https://github.com/pparaxan/Cazic_Tauri) Cazic is my music player, built with Tauri funny enough... Remove all of the Tauri stuff out of this and now it's a example for Crowsa... Wow.
